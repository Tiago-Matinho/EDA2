# EDA2-Airport

**Djikstra's** algorithm implementation.

# Story

Due to the short number of direct flights between two airports, sometimes when flying, we have to take multiple flights to reach our destination.
So when booking a trip we have to take into account not only the flight schedule but also the duration of the flights as well as the time spent in airports waiting for the next flight.

# Task

Calculate the shortest trip from one airport to another and show all the flights schedule needed to reach the final destination.
